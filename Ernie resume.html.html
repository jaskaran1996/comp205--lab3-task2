            <h2>Construction / Carpenter</h2>
        
            <p>I graduated high school 2007 at CCVS, after graduating I went into the work place for construction, I worked on and off since graduation, then finally I found a job with construction that would last me 3 years, it was a fun 3 years until it stopped due to lack of money. Since being layed off I decided to go back to school for carpentry which was a 12 week program where I graduated and got my apprenticeship card for construction.</p>
